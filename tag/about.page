This extension activates the tagging feature by utilizing the `kind` property on the page. This extension will also add several new routes such as `http://127.0.0.1/blog/tag/slug` on every page to allow users to list all pages in the current folder by a tag.

### Condition

These page conditional statements are available:

 - `$site->has('tags')` → Return `true` if current page has at least one tag.
 - `$site->is('tags')` → `Return `true` if current items view is a tags view and is not empty.

### Class

These HTML classes will be added to the `<html>` element that has a `class` attribute:

 - `has-tags` → Will be added if current page has at least one tag.
 - `is-tags` → Will be added if current items view is a tags view and is not empty.
